Rocket Calendar is a speedy, always-accessible calendar that lives in your menu bar. You can quickly check dates, navigate between months, and even copy the selected date to your clipboard! Heading back to today's date is always a single click away.

Dark and Light appearances are both supported and you can change the color of the selected date by changing your accent color in System Preferences.

The format for the copied date can be customized by changing your date format in System Preferences.

You can run Rocket Calendar automatically when logging in and setup a global keyboard shortcut for launching the calendar menu in the Preferences menu.
