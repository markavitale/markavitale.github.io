# Mark A Vitale
I'm a software engineer who's worked on mostly-native apps for Apple platforms in some form for most of my career. I've also worked on CI/CD and custom build tooling for the same. If you're more interested in my work experience, feel free to check out my Linked In profile below.

I mostly have this domain for email purposes, but may write use it to drop some unorganized thoughts on something I find interesting. This is a personal website and all the thoughts should be treated as my own, as poorly thought out, and as probably wrong.

{% if site.posts.size > 0 %}
## Unorganized thoughts
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
